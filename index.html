			I was born in Sudan, Africa. I moved to Canada at the young age of 1. After moving around a bit, I ended up settling and growing up in London, Ontario. <br>My current aim is to learn how to write the coding for websites. I also want to learn about the design aspect of website. My hobbies include video games, <br>playing instruments (such as the piano and guitar), and singing. My dreams and aspirations involve theatre. I've always had a huge interest in acting and <br>singing and love being apart of plays, whether big or small.

		<h1>Hello! I'm Jacob Kasza.</h1>
		<p>
			I was born in Calgary, Alberta and moved to London, Ontario when I was a year old. I am interested in both illustration and website development (front and back-end); I am hoping that the Interactive Media Design program helps me choose which to focus on. <br> I have been to postsecondary school many times; in 2013 I attended King's at UWO for psychology, in 2017 I attended Fanshawe main campus for computer programming. After these experiences, I finally decided to stick with this program because coding and the Adobe Creative Cloud suite is fun to me! <br> I have been working retail for over seven years. Right now I am a cashier at Rexall, and if I'm not at work or doing homework, I am probably watching Netflix or on social media.
