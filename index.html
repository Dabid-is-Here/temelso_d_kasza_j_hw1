			I was born in Sudan, Africa. I moved to Canada at the young age of 1. After moving around a bit, I ended up settling and growing up in London, Ontario. <br>My current aim is to learn how to write the coding for websites. I also want to learn about the design aspect of website. My hobbies include video games, <br>playing instruments (such as the piano and guitar), and singing. My dreams and aspirations involve theatre. I've always had a huge interest in acting and <br>singing and love being apart of plays, whether big or small.
